## deploykit ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/deploy-deploykit-blue)

<blockquote>
The script needs two variables from the env "ENV_DIR" & "DEPLOY_DIR"
I would recommend that you add something like:
export ENV_DIR=/path/to/directories-with-env-files
export DEPLOY_DIR=/path/to/directories-with-deploy-scripts
Also ensure that these directories <b>only have files</b>
